### Built with

### What I learned

This project was a huge learning curve for me. I learned a lot about CSS Grid and I feel much more comfortable working with it.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would love to experiment with wrapping grids and making my displays responsive to how it looks. This means having the text size change proportionally to the screen size.
